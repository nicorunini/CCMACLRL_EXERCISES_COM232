# Assignment 1

Using k-Nearest Neighbours, predict if a student will **Pass (1)** or **Fail (0)** based on:

- $X_1$ = Hours Studied
- $X_2$ = Sleep Hours

---

## Training Data (10 Students)

| Student | Hours Studied $X_1$ | Sleep Hours $X_2$ | Pass/Fail (Y) |
| ------- | ------------------- | ----------------- | ------------- |
| 1       | 1.0                 | 5.0               | 0 (Fail)      |
| 2       | 2.0                 | 5.5               | 0 (Fail)      |
| 3       | 3.0                 | 6.0               | 0 (Fail)      |
| 4       | 4.5                 | 5.0               | 0 (Fail)      |

## Task

A new student studied **4 hours** and slept **6 hours**.  
We want to predict whether they **Pass** or **Fail** using **KNN with k = 3**.

---

## 1. Plot all data points using a scatter plot (10 points)

- Use a circle üîµ for students who failed.
- Use a square üü• for students who passed.
- Use a star ‚≠ê for the unknown data point.

---

## 2. Compute Distances (10 points)

**Note:** Please show all solutions

For the new student, compute the **Euclidean distance** from all data points:

$$
d = \sqrt{(X_1 - 4)^2 + (X_2 - 6)^2}
$$

Fill in the table below:

| Student | Hours Studied (X1) | Sleep Hours (X2) | Pass/Fail (Y) | Euclidean Distance |
| ------- | ------------------ | ---------------- | ------------- | ------------------ |
| 1       | 1.0                | 5.0              | 0             | ?                  |
| 2       | 2.0                | 5.5              | 0             | ?                  |
| 3       | 3.0                | 6.0              | 0             | ?                  |
| 4       | 4.5                | 5.0              | 0             | ?                  |
| 5       | 5.0                | 6.5              | 1             | ?                  |
| 6       | 5.5                | 7.0              | 1             | ?                  |
| 7       | 6.0                | 6.0              | 1             | ?                  |
| 8       | 7.0                | 7.0              | 1             | ?                  |

## 4. Discussion Questions (5 points)

1. What was your final prediction?
2. How would the prediction change if we used **k = 5** instead of **k = 3**?
